-This text file explains how the Microvenus experiment is implemented using phase-change model
-This code demonstrates how the first experiment of DNA data storage works
-This experiment primarily had artistic purposes
-Here, artificial information is incorporated in E.coli Bacteria
-The ancient Germanic rune for life and the female earth, bit-mapped to a binary representation to be incorporated into the bacteria.
-This resulted in a 5×7 or 7×5 figure, totaling 35 bits as shown in the image in the readme file
-This binary grid is mapped to nucleotides with the help of phase-change model
-Phase change model works in the following manner
-Nucleotide indicates how may times a bit (0 or 1)is repeated before bit change occurs:
    X → C
    XX → T
    XXX → A
    XXXX → G
-Hence the bit sequence 10101 01110 00100 00100 00100 00100 00100 is mapped to CCCCCCAACGCGCGCGCT
